/**
 * This class is taken from the "World of Zuul" application.
 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.
 * <p>
 * This parser reads user input and tries to interpret it as an "Adventure"
 * command. Every time it is called it reads a line from the terminal and
 * tries to interpret the line as a three word command. It returns the command
 * as an object of class Command.
 * <p>
 * The parser has a set of known command words. It checks user input against
 * the known commands, and if the input is not one of the known commands, it
 * returns a command object that is marked as an unknown command.
